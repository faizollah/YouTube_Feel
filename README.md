# ML MIDTERM FLASK (AND MAYBE REACT) PROJECT!!!
------
based on flaskex but with a bunch of stuff.

on a development environment you need to get the config from firebase. 
The Heroku is setup to deploy everytime there is a git push on the master 
branch of this repository but it already has the productin environment variables
so there's nothing to do there. I will add team members to all the accounts.


to get it running in a local dev environment:
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:ML-Midterm-Finance/ml-midterm-flask.git

$ cd ml-midterm-flask

$ pip install -r requirements.txt

$ python app.py
```
